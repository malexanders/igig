Does it make sense to only declare variables in the scope where they are required?
* I declared variables in the initMap scope because I didn't know all the places where I may need them.


How can I apply OOP to my code so far?
In what ways can I make my code more scalable?

objects:
* map
* tour
* route
* marker
* routebox


* tips for improving skills?
* references?
* looking for a job right now, any advice? Preparing for interview etc.
